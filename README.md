# walker

## Overview
Modify the TurtleBot simulation from the lecture and implement a simple walker algorithm much like a Roomba robot vacuum cleaner. The robot should move forward until it reaches an obstacle (but not colliding), then rotate in place until the way ahead is clear, then move forward again and repeat.
